My Steps:
- Orderlines
1. "unit_price" Datatype needs to be changed into a float
1_1. find all the rows that include several Dots in the Number
1_2. Delete the first Dot that appears
1_3. Convert the column now into float

2. "date" needs to be changed into Datatime
2_1. Simple Convert

3. "product_id" is useless
3_1. drop the column "product_id"

- Orders
1. "created_date" needs to be changed into Datatime
1_1. Simple Convert

2. "total_paid" has some NaNs
2_1. Find all the "order_id" rows which have "total_paid" = NaN and save them into nan_orders
2_2. Find the rows in Orderlines that match with nan_orders("order_id" == "id_order")
2_3. Save up the sum of "unit_price" per "id_order"
2_4. Replace the NaNs with the saved values

- Products
1. Delete all the duplicated Products

2. "price" is a mess (some of the numbers make no sense)
2_1. Save up the highest value of "unit_price" per "sku"
2_2. Merge them onto Products as a new column
2_3. Find all the rows where "price" has several Dots
2_4. Replace those faulty numbers with the values from the new column
2_5. Convert to numeric

3. "desc" has some NaNs
3_1. Find the rows where "desc" == NaN
3_2. Replace those with the "name" from the same row

4. Find all thew rows where "price" is NaN
4_1. Replace "price" in those rows with their "unit_price" (That we got from Orderlines previously)

5. "type" has some NaNs
5_1. Find all those rows
5_2. Replace them with the Number part of the "sku" of the row

6. "promo price" can't tell us anything
6_1. Drop the column
